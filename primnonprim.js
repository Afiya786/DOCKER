// Primitive data types are the fundamental data types built into a programming language.
// They are used to represent single values.
// They are usually immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are assigned.
// Examples of primitive data types in JavaScript include numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols (ES6), and bigints (ES11).


//---------------------------><--------------//
// Non-Primitive Data Types (Complex Data Types or Reference Data Types):
// Non-primitive data types are more complex data structures that can hold multiple values or objects.


// Examples of non-primitive data types in JavaScript include objects, arrays, functions, and custom classes or instances created using constructors.
