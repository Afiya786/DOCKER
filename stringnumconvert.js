// note: if our string is  at first place than all the other numbers are treated as string
// and if the first is number than every other is treated as number

// let x = 3
// let y = x++
// console.log(x)
// console.log(y)

// let x = 3: You declare a variable x and assign it the value 3.

// let y = x++: You declare a variable y and assign it the value of x before incrementing x. 
// The x++ operation is a post-increment operation, 
// which means it first assigns the current value of x to y and then increments x by 1.
